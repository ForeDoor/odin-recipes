    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Buffalo cauliflower is a great substitution for Buffalo wings and can be made gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. 
        Make sure to coat your cookie sheet well with oil, or the cauliflower will stick. You can dip the cauliflower in ranch 
        or blue cheese for added flavor, but it doesn't need it. All-purpose flour can be used in place of gluten-free if 
        desired. Since gluten-free flour uses less liquid than wheat flour, you may have to adjust the amount of liquid in 
        the recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 heads cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup gluten-free baking flour (such as Premium Gold® Flax and Ancient Grains All-Purpose Flour)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk together water, flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until batter is smooth and 
            somewhat runny. Add cauliflower pieces to batter and mix until evenly coated; spread onto the prepared 
            baking sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat; stir in hot pepper sauce and honey until 
            smooth. Brush hot sauce mixture over each cauliflower piece, repeating until all is used.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until cauliflower is browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes 
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
