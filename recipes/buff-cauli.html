    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Buffalo cauliflower is a great substitution for Buffalo wings and can be made gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. 
        Make sure to coat your cookie sheet well with oil, or the cauliflower will stick. You can dip the cauliflower in ranch 
        or blue cheese for added flavor, but it doesn't need it.</p>
